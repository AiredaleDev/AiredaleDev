### Welcome!

Most of my programming for fun is done in Rust, Zig, Go, or Haskell. I have a soft spot for functional languages. I'm currently learning the ins and outs of operating systems by building one with some friends!

My pinned repos contain whatever (publicly available) projects that I'm most proud of at any given time.
