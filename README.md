### Welcome!

Most of my programming for fun is done in Rust, Zig, Go, and Haskell, usually to experiment with some approach to writing software.

### Computing books I'm reading
* [Essentials of Compilation in Racket](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Compilation-Incremental-Approach-Racket/dp/0262047764/)
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
