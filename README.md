### Welcome!

Most of my programming for fun is done in Rust, Zig, Go, and Haskell. I'm currently learning the ins and outs of operating systems by building one with some friends.

My pinned repos contain whatever (publicly available) projects that I'm most proud of at the moment. I've finally gotten to the point where I feel I've developed enough skill to build more complex things on my own, so expect these pins to evolve with time!
