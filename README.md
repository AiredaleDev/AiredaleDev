### Welcome!

This is a repository of everything I've made or have contributed towards that I think is worthy of some attention.

Like most people, I start many more projects than I get properly working, let alone "finish", so I tend to like to cook a project on-and-off for months or years before I make it public.

Generally speaking, I'm interested in a problem if it requries some knowledge of hardware and/or involves interesting math as a core component.
In the mix, there are a couple projects which I've worked on professionally:
* [QWERTY](https://github.com/gt-tinker/qwerty) -- High-level (i.e. "basis-translations", if you're familiar) language and compiler for quantum computers embedded in Python.
* [MFlowCode](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC) -- Exascale Physics Simulation

### Reading List

#### Current:
* Types and Programming Languages by Benjamin C. Pierce

#### Done:
* Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom (started 2022, last referenced 2023)

...and a few others whose names are presently escaping me.
