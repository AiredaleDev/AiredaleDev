### Welcome!

Hi there! My name is Cameron, and I love building robust software that resourcefully leverages your whole machine!

I'm really interested in compilers and program optimization. My favorite problems to work on require knowledge of hardware and/or involve interesting math as a core component.

Here on my Github, there are a couple projects which I've worked on professionally:
* [QWERTY](https://github.com/gt-tinker/qwerty) -- High-level (i.e. "basis-translations", if you're familiar) language and compiler for quantum computers embedded in Python.
* [MFlowCode](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC) -- Exascale Physics Simulation that can utilize every GPU in [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/)!

### Reading List

#### Current:
* Types and Programming Languages by Benjamin C. Pierce

#### Done:
* Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom (started 2022, last referenced 2023)

...and a few others whose names are presently escaping me.
